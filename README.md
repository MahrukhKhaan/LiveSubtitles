# LiveSubtitles

In our real lives, we are faced with people who cannot comprehend the speaker’s speech due to different reasons such as they may be hearing impaired or simply may not have a command over the spoken language or may not be able to grasp the speaker’s accent. “Live Subtitles” is an approach towards minimizing communication hurdles, which provides real-time speech to text conversion, allowing the users to view and read the speaker’s speech in live conversations. This project is implemented as an android app to ease users in their daily lives. Augmented Reality allows the text to be overlaid on screen of the user’s mobile. The text may be the content of the speech in either the same language or a different one, translated on the basis of user’s preferred language.
